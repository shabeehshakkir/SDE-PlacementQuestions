# Recursion

### What is recursion ?<br>
When function is called within the same function, it is known as recursion

```cpp
void do_something()
{
    ... .. ...
    do_something();
    ... .. ...
}

int main()
{
    ... .. ...
    do_something();
    ... .. ...
}
```

### What is base case?
A base case is the bottom point of a recursive program or we will get the output at this stage

Example:- Factorial of a number. Here the end point is 1!
